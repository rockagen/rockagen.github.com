    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2000,  when I thought I was going to be a professional writer,  I spent hours a day on LiveJournal doing writing practice with other aspiring poets and authors. Since then I&#8217;ve blogged at three different domains about web standards,  print design,  photography,  Flash,  illustration,  information architecture,  ColdFusion,  package management,  PHP,  CSS,  advertising,  Ruby,  Rails,  and Erlang.</p>

<p>I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic. But as much as I enjoy blogging,  I seem to be stuck in a cycle of quitting and starting over. Before starting the current iteration,  I resolved to do some introspection to determine the factors that were leading to this destructive pattern.</p>

<p>I already knew a lot about what I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> want. I was tired of complicated blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts,  not style a zillion template pages,  moderate comments all day long,  and constantly lag behind the latest software release. Something like Posterous looked attractive,  but I wanted to style my blog,  and it needed to be hosted at the domain of my choosing. For the same reason,  other hosted sites (wordpress.com,  blogger.com) were disqualified. There are a few people directly using GitHub as a blog (which is very cool),  but that&#8217;s a bit too much of an impedance mismatch for my tastes.</p>

<p>On Sunday,  October 19th,  I sat down in my San Francisco apartment with a glass of apple cider and a clear mind. After a period of reflection,  I had an idea. While I&#8217;m not specifically trained as an author of prose,  I <em>am</em> trained as an author of code. What would happen if I approached blogging from a software development perspective? What would that look like?</p>
